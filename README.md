# 2020
Hacktoberfest 2020 project 
2020 is possibly the worst year so far.
I think we can all agree when we say we would like to dig a hole and bury ourselves in it.  
But look on the bright side! 
We did gain more time to exercise, spend time with family, and even on ourselves! 
And thankfully some governments and people have played their part in containing the spread of coronavirus. 
At any rate, 2020 is ending soon. Let's just hope 2021 takes a turn for the better!
